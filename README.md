# My experience
The list of experience is grouped into: 
* [ML Algorithms](https://github.com/tmgthb/portfolio/blob/main/README.md#algorithms), 
* [Applications](https://github.com/tmgthb/portfolio/blob/main/README.md#Applications), 
* [Python packages](https://github.com/tmgthb/portfolio/blob/main/README.md#Libraries) and 
* [Machine learning concepts](https://github.com/tmgthb/portfolio/blob/main/README.md#Concepts). 

## Algorithms
The list is to give an idea of the type of algorithms, which I have worked.

## Applications
I add here few examples of sample applications, which I have worked and are available publicly.
* [GPT-3 - Text generator](https://share.streamlit.io/tmgthb/gpt-3/main/gpt3.py)
* [GPT-Neo - Text generator](https://share.streamlit.io/tmgthb/gptneo/main/gptneo.py)
* [COVID Daily Statistics](https://share.streamlit.io/tmgthb/covid/main/covid.py)


## Libraries
The Python library list is to offer an idea of the type of Python libraries & APIs, which I have worked. 
* MLOps: 
* Natural Language Processing: Open AI API, NLTK, regex
* Deep learning: Tensorflow/Keras, Pytorch
* Machine learning xgboost, LightGBM,
* Flask [example](https://github.com/tmgthb/flask) and integrating it with **SQLite**, **Jinja2** and **Bokeh**-visualizations. 
* Visualization libraries experience: **Dash**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Bokeh** 
* Data manipulation: Numpy, Pandas, [JSON - example](https://github.com/tmgthb/portfolio/blob/main/json/json_example.py)
* Other libraries: Folium, Geopy, Foursquare-location data with k-means clustering - Neighborhood segmentation 

## Concepts

[My blog](https://medium.com/@tmmtt/) is available in Medium platform. I plan to write more and in the profile page you can find the complete list of my entries.
